Description:
This is a simple chatbot which responds to user's general queries about the Web Enthusiasts Club.
It has been developed using DialogFlow and Google Cloud.Although a lot of effort has been made to widen the scope of the chatbot, but still there is scope for improvement.
It can fetch realtime data from spreadsheets depending on user's queries.The spreadsheets were converted to a RESTful APi and were then linked using Axios.

Technologies used:DialogFlow, Axios, Google Cloud

1.DialogFlow Official Documentation

I am stil working to add new features and widen the scope of the chatbot. Your feedback will be a great help in improving the chatbot.

Thanks...
